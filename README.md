### Testing the server-deployment

Set up your testing framework: Choose a testing framework such as Jest,  and configure it in your Node.js project. Write your test cases to cover the desired functionality and ensure they can be executed successfully on your local machine.

Test and deploy: Push changes to your repository, triggering the CI workflow. Once the tests pass, the CD workflow will be triggered automatically, deploying your application according to the specified deployment steps.
